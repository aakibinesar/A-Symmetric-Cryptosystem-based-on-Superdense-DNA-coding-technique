This work grew from my knowledge of Quantum Computing and Bioinformatics. I wanted to integrate DNA encoding with Quantum Cryptography in order to build an efficient Superdense Coding circuit, termed "Superdense DNA Coding". This work was submitted at the 37th Computer Security Foundations Symposium 2024. Due to it's futile security analysis, this paper got rejected. However, this work was the basis of my learning of Quantum Computing techniques such as entanglement, bell states and Superdense Coding.
